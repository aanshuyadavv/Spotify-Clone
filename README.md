# Spotify-Clone

I've made a `Spotify` clone using `HTML` `CSS`. Though, it is not responsive.

Before using these image files please create a folder with name `images` and send all these image files provided to you in this folder named `images`.


I didn't know how to select the whole folder on `github`. As a result, I'd to add images files only to `repository` and not with the folder.

Please make `images` folder before using image files.
